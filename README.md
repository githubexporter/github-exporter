# Prometheus GitHub Exporter

Exposes basic metrics for your repositories from the GitHub API, to a Prometheus compatible endpoint.

## Configuration

This exporter is setup to take input from environment variables. All variables are optional:

* `ORGS` If supplied, the exporter will enumerate all repositories for that organization. Expected in the format "org1, org2".
* `REPOS` If supplied, The repos you wish to monitor, expected in the format "user/repo1, user/repo2". Can be across different Github users/orgs.
* `USERS` If supplied, the exporter will enumerate all repositories for that users. Expected in
  the format "user1, user2".
* `GITHUB_TOKEN` If supplied, enables the user to supply a github authentication token that allows the API to be queried more often. Optional, but recommended.
* `GITHUB_TOKEN_FILE` If supplied _instead of_ `GITHUB_TOKEN`, enables the user to supply a path to a file containing a github authentication token that allows the API to be queried more often. Optional, but recommended.
* `GITHUB_APP` If true , authenticates ass GitHub app to the API.
* `GITHUB_APP_ID` The APP ID of the GitHub App.
* `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` The INSTALLATION ID of the GitHub App.
* `GITHUB_APP_KEY_PATH` The path to the github private key.
* `GITHUB_RATE_LIMIT` The RATE LIMIT that suppose to be for github app (default is 15,000). If the exporter sees the value is below this variable it generating new token for the app.
* `API_URL` Github API URL, shouldn't need to change this. Defaults to `https://api.github.com`
* `LISTEN_PORT` The port you wish to run the container on, the Dockerfile defaults this to `9171`
* `METRICS_PATH` the metrics URL path you wish to use, defaults to `/metrics`
* `LOG_LEVEL` The level of logging the exporter will run with, defaults to `debug`


## Install and deploy

Run manually from Docker Hub:
```
docker run -d --restart=always -p 9171:9171 -e REPOS="infinityworks/ranch-eye, infinityworks/prom-conf" githubexporter/github-exporter
```

Run manually from Docker Hub (With GitHub App):
```
docker run -d --restart=always -p 9171:9171 --read-only -v ./key.pem:/key.pem -e GITHUB_APP=true -e GITHUB_APP_ID= -e GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID= -e GITHUB_APP_KEY_PATH=/key.pem <IMAGE_NAME>
```

Build a docker image:
```
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

## Docker compose

```
github-exporter:
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    expose:
      - 9171
    ports:
      - 9171:9171
    image: githubexporter/github-exporter:latest
    environment:
      - REPOS=<REPOS you want to monitor>
      - GITHUB_TOKEN=<your github api token>
```

## Docker compose (GitHub App)

```
github-exporter-github-app:
  tty: true
  stdin_open: true
  expose:
    - 9171
  ports:
    - 9171:9171
  build: .
  environment:
    - LOG_LEVEL=debug
    - LISTEN_PORT=9171
    - GITHUB_APP=true
    - GITHUB_APP_ID=
    - GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID=
    - GITHUB_APP_KEY_PATH=/key.pem
  restart: unless-stopped
  volumes:
    - "./key.pem:/key.pem:ro"

```

## Metrics

Metrics will be made available on port 9171 by default
An example of these metrics can be found in the `METRICS.md` markdown file in the root of this repository

## Tests

There is a set of blackbox behavioural tests which validate metrics endpoint in the `test` directory.
Run as follows

```bash
make test
```

## Version Release Procedure
Once a new pull request has been merged into `master` the following script should be executed locally. The script will trigger a new image build in docker hub with the new image having the tag `release-<version>`. The version is taken from the `VERSION` file and must follow semantic versioning. For more information see [semver.org](https://semver.org/).

Prior to running the following command ensure the number has been increased to desired version in `VERSION`:

```bash
./release-version.sh
```
